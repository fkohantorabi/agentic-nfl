Use the following guidelines while assessing how each injury impacts the teams outcome:

1. Quarterback (QB)
Role: The offensive leader, responsible for calling plays, reading defenses, passing, and sometimes running the ball.
Importance: Highest – The QB is the most impactful player on the field. A top-tier QB can elevate an entire team; losing a starting QB is often devastating.
Impact of Loss: Significant drop-off in offensive production; backups rarely match starter performance.

2. Offensive Line (OL: LT, LG, C, RG, RT)
Role: Protects the QB, opens lanes for the running game. Includes Left Tackle (LT), Right Tackle (RT), Guards (LG/RG), and Center (C).
Importance: Very High – A strong OL is foundational for both passing and running success.
Impact of Loss: Losing an elite LT or Center is especially damaging. OL depth is often thin, leading to increased QB pressure and run game inefficiency.

3. Wide Receiver (WR)
Role: Creates separation, catches passes, stretches defenses vertically and horizontally.
Importance: High – Star WRs can transform passing attacks, but overall unit depth often mitigates single-player loss.
Impact of Loss: Losing a top WR hurts, especially if the team relies heavily on the passing game or has few secondary options.

4. Running Back (RB)
Role: Carries the ball on rushing plays, catches passes out of the backfield, blocks in pass protection.
Importance: Moderate – Elite RBs can swing games, but many teams succeed with rotational backs.
Impact of Loss: Less severe than other positions if the OL is strong and backups are competent.

5. Tight End (TE)
Role: Hybrid role: receiver and blocker. Can create mismatches if athletic.
Importance: Moderate – Especially impactful in systems that rely heavily on TEs (e.g., Chiefs, Ravens).
Impact of Loss: Depends on scheme. In TE-centric offenses, a major loss.

6. Defensive Line (DL: DE, DT, NT)
Role: Stops the run, pressures the QB. Includes Defensive Ends (DE) and Tackles (DT/NT).
Importance: High – Strong DLs disrupt both run and pass. Interior DL is critical to run defense, edge rushers vital for pass rush.
Impact of Loss: Losing a dominant edge rusher or interior lineman significantly affects defensive performance.

7. Linebacker (LB: MLB, OLB)
Role: Versatile – run defense, pass coverage, blitzing. Middle LB (MLB) often calls defensive plays.
Importance: Moderate to High – Top LBs stabilize defenses; elite pass-rushing OLBs can be game changers.
Impact of Loss: Losing a defensive leader or elite pass rusher can hurt both performance and communication.

8. Cornerback (CB)
Role: Covers WRs, defends passes, key to stopping explosive plays.
Importance: Very High – Elite CBs can neutralize top WRs; weak CBs get targeted constantly.
Impact of Loss: Losing a shutdown CB significantly weakens pass defense.

9. Safety (S: FS, SS)
Role: Last line of defense, supports both pass coverage (FS) and run defense (SS).
Importance: Moderate to High – Good safeties prevent big plays and cover up defensive mistakes.
Impact of Loss: More severe in schemes that rely on safeties for coverage versatility or run support.

10. Special Teams (K, P, KR/PR)
Role: Field goals, punts, kick/punt returns, field position.
Importance: Moderate – Kickers and punters can swing close games; return specialists are less impactful unless elite.
Impact of Loss: Inconsistent kickers can cost wins; punting depth generally stable.
